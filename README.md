# Helmet-Detection-System

A Machine Learning model, which aims to identify whether a person on a bike is wearing Helmet or not. 

The sole motive of designing this model is to increase the safety among the traffic bike riders. Strictly following of the traffic rules can be brought into action by charging the fine on every mistake that the rider commits. This will also help to reduce the number of injuries occured due to road accidents. 

This System has been designed using YOLO ( You Only Look Once ) Algorithm, which further uses the concept of Bounding Box Regression. It analyze the head part of the rider and tracks whether the Helmet is present or not by forming the Bounding Box Coordinates around the upper section. 

More than 800 images has been tested using Py_Image tool by generating the bounding box coordinates for each image.

Complete Code is implemented within Python Modules and Libraries, and Database at Backend has been hosted using Google's Firebase. Fronted has been implemented using HTML and CSS, and Python is written within Google Colabs respectively.
